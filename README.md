# frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game

A classic arcade game, the third project in Udacity Front-End Nanodegree program. The game engine and visual assets were provided, my task was to implement game logic, create the character and enemy class and its methods. As an extra, I also added a gameboard.

The player has to go through a lane avoiding the bugs.
Once it reaches the water it starts from the default position and its score incremented.
Every time the player scores the bugs' speed increases.
if the player fails to avoid one of the bugs and collides with it, it gets back to the default position and its health decrements.
